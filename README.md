# üí° Problem Statement

One of the most traditional games in India is "Antakshari" where a person sings a song based on the sound that the last song ended on. In our Web application the users can play a game in single-player or multi-player mode where they are assigned a mood upon a level completion. Based on the mood that they get they have to sing a song and based on how well they sing the same, our model model assigns them a score based on how good they displayed the emotion.
